        <h3>Sam Spade</h3>
        <p>Introverted Intuition (Ni): Spade deduces things through guesswork, and his guesses don’t always make sense to those around him. He gleans that Brigid O’Shaughnessy is lying, he quickly puts together the pieces surrounding the black bird, and he senses something off about Miles’ murder that he can’t put into words. He’s good at making plans, at anticipating his enemies moves, and at setting up a complicated web to take down everyone involved in the case.</p>
        <p>Extroverted Thinking (Te): He likes to gather all the information possible around him, and demands that others be honest. He’s plenty honest himself, usually relating blunt recitations of facts in ways that make him sound insensitive - of his partner “(he had) ten thousand insurance, no children, and a wife that didn’t like him”. He’s good at arranging other people and outmaneuvering them via complex plans.</p>
        <p>Introverted Feeling (Fi): “Don’t be so sure I’m as crooked as I’m supposed to be”. Spade has very strict principles; he investigates his partner’s death because it’s the right thing to do, not because he liked him personally; he turns Brigid in because it’s correct, even though he’s in love with her. He’s private with his feelings and hard to approach or figure out emotionally.</p>
        <p>Extroverted Sensing (Se): Spade is attentive to his surroundings. He’s good at taking action when needs be. He’s observant and quick to see when someone is following him, but not impulsive (usually) or quick to jump into a situation.</p>

        <h3>Jay Gatsby</h3>
        <p>Introverted Intuition (Ni) / Extroverted Sensing (Se) Gatsby, from the very beginning, “visualizes and imagines” a better life than the one he has; as a child, he decides his future will be one of wealth and importance. Once he sees Daisy, he immediately knows that she is what he wants and he spends years conceptualizing the perfect way to get her into his arms. He anticipates her behavior and strives to incorporate it into his big idea. The lavish estate and parties are the result of imagining the “perfect” situation in his head, then bringing it into reality. Gatsby is an idealistic romantic in many ways, with an unusual, profound, and poetic way of viewing the world, and an imagination that allows him to spin the most incredible stories, that off the bat, his friends doubt are true. He has exquisite and extremely expensive taste and is a reckless driver, but more importantly, Gatsby sees opportunities to act and takes them… saving a man at sea, becoming romantically involved with Daisy, leaping on black market trading, etc. Even as a child, he hungered for a rich and opulent lifestyle, and he seems to enjoy the effect of his parties and making them spectacular even though he remains distant from them (inferior Se).</p>
        <p>Extroverted Feeling (Fe) / Introverted Thinking (Ti) Gatsby places an enormous amount of emphasis on being “polite” and accommodating, asking Nick what days are best for him to drop in for tea, and ensuring he feels warm and welcomed at the “social event of the season.” But his entire drive is built around winning over Daisy, drawing her attention, and convincing her of his worth. He frets over his needs and wants and desires, asking Nick for advice and help in getting her to open up to him. He cares about how others see him, and needs her to reject her husband and society and come be with him, in order to feel at peace with himself. Gatsby is an enigma, never completely himself, but always wearing a mask. He feels so strongly that his perspective on the situation is right that he needs Daisy to answer that she has only ever loved him, and doesn’t understand the idea of her having loved Tom earlier in their relationship. He has so fixated on her, idealizing her as the perfect match, that he fails to analyze his own reasons for wanting her or accept that society will never embrace him, no matter how much money he makes – and neither will Daisy.</p>
        <p>Gatsby is ambitious, concealing his “shameful” past behind a made-up façade of importance. He has earned a lot of money, all in his aim to be a man worthy of Daisy. He befriends Nick simply for an “in” with his cousin and subtly manipulates the situation to get his way. He’s angry when she refuses to play his game and leave with him.</p>
        <p>Gatsby is a perfect example of a sexual 3 – someone who focuses on becoming powerful, successful, and desirable to attract a specific person, often without introspection or self-reflection, out of a desire to earn their love, respect, and admiration. He throws lavish parties and chases success only to appeal to Daisy. He is dishonest about his true life and past, choosing to re-interpret it as a fantastical adventure in which he always looks good. When Daisy disappoints him, he becomes passive, anxious, and reflective, distant from other people and full of non-ambition (moving into 9). His 2 wing craves love and acceptance from the socialites that will never accept him, and causes him to use his “generosity” to attract relationships to him. As an sx/so, Jay feels he cannot be loved for himself, he has to win Daisy over by showing off his wealth and influence – by buying her, and maintaining a facade; he’s afraid to let her see the man he is underneath, so he fabricates and invents to hold her affection.</p>
        <h3>Hercule Poirot (INXJ)</h3>
        <p>Ni/Se means a preference for intuitive insight / singular conclusions / reading between the lines imbalanced with detachment from sensory reality (Se). INXJ characters all struggle with making impulsive decisions under pressure, never knowing when the right moment to act is, and often, a sense of fussiness and/or unrealistic demands from sensory reality. This is extremely apparent in Poirot, who must have everything ‘just so’ / is a total perfectionist, trying to force reality to conform to his higher ideal.</p>
        <p>Poirot has a habit of forming an internal impression about a crime and then either waiting for it to happen as he predicted (so he has a case) or in sitting everyone down and impressing them by airing his final judgment – with a Ni, that’s all you see: the end conclusion, not the audible process. Because he is a Fe, he wants to impress other people with his intelligence, and he is influenced by emotional appeals, as well as completely understands human nature. Poirot is good at understanding emotional motivations and not discounting them.</p>
        <h3>Sherlock Holmes (ISTP)</h3>
        <p>Sherlock has built an internal framework of how reality works, and whenever anything happens that does not fit into what he sees as logical, he rejects it – or becomes upset, at the idea that he could be wrong. His actions in the “Hound” case, being unable to accept seeing a ghost hound, and trying to rationalize it away, show a severe Ti inability to accept anything essentially IRRATIONAL. Unlike his brother Mycroft, he is not focused on monetary gain, or having a “real job,” but instead on enjoying the fun of solving puzzles. He thinks constantly, compiling, analyzing, and sorting through data to search for logical consistencies, to solve a crime by discerning the motives as well as what truly happened. Sherlock’s inferior Fe often manifests in public, emotional outbursts, childish behaviors (refusing to put on clothes in Buckingham Palace), using manipulation to get what he wants, and being generally inconsiderate of John and the rest of society. He does, however, deeply crave other people’s admiration and it wears on him not to be the smartest man in the room. His observable emotions worry Mycroft, because they’re so visible.</p>
        <p>Sherlock is excellent at looking at his sensory environment, and noticing its smallest details, down to a cat hair on someone’s leg. He uses this sensory data to form conclusions about their motives, intentions, reasons for being there, and what he should do next, to solve the case and prompt a reaction. He is also prone to addiction, thriving on getting out and doing the leg-work in his cases. He alleviates his boredom by spearing pigs, doing research, and indulging in drugs. Once he has the physical details of a case, Sherlock forms an opinion and stubbornly refuses to waver from it. Sometimes, things catch him off guard – and he reacts primarily in the moment, but he likes to have a semi-sense of a plan going into situations. His tendency to be reckless, such as when he baited someone in the aquarium, sometimes winds up with unforeseen consequences – the death of someone he cares about.</p>
        <p>Rather than be ambitious and use his powers to advance himself, Sherlock chose to indulge his intellect. He enjoys solving puzzles just for the fun it. He has a boundless desire for knowledge, absorbing whatever he can find that is “useful and interesting” to his casework. He over-relies on his wits, sometimes blowing his talents out of proportion. It’s a crushing blow, if he thinks he hasn’t figured out the truth.</p>
        <h3>John Yossarian(ENTP)</h3>
        <p>Yossarian does not have the traits of a typical hero. He does not risk his life to save others; in fact, his primary goal is to avoid risking his life whenever possible. But the system of values around Yossarian is so skewed that this approach seems to be the only truly moral stance he can take, if only because it is so logical. Yossarian seizes hold of one true, logical idea—that he should try to preserve life. Unlike a conventional hero, however, Yossarian does not generalize this idea to mean that he should risk his own life in attempts to save everybody else’s. In a world where life itself is so undervalued and so casually lost, it is possible to redefine heroism as simple self-preservation.</p>
        <p>This insistence on self-preservation creates a conflict for Yossarian. Even though he is determined to save his own life at all costs, he nonetheless cares deeply for the other members of his squadron and is traumatized by their deaths. His ongoing horror at Snowden’s death stems both from his pity for Snowden and from his horrified realization that his own body is just as destructible as Snowden’s. In the end, when offered a choice between his own safety and the safety of the entire squadron, Yossarian is unable to choose himself over others. This concern for others complicates the simple logic of self-preservation, and creates its own Catch-22: life is not worth living without a moral concern for the well-being of others, but a moral concern for the well-being of others endangers one’s life. Yossarian ultimately escapes this conundrum by literally walking away from the war—an action that refuses both the possibility of becoming an officer who avoids danger at the expense of his troops and that of remaining a soldier who risks his life for meaningless reasons.</p>
